\subsection{Measuring Time: getTime64()}
        The used tool for evaluate time component of algorithm analysis, was the function getTime64(). It's referenced in StackOverflow and blá blá blá;

        //insert code here

        The acquisition was taken with 2 refinement: The generated figures are done in different archives, to avoid any delay caused by code itself (like add and print functions between main propose).
        And for each size of generated image, was taken 2 check points: the first one as soon as program initiate and right before showing results and closing; the other one, focus only on Image generation (loop for) to test reading/writting performance.
